# Project Title:
- Predictive Analysis of Graduate Admission Chances for Jamboree Students

# Problem Statement:
- Jamboree has recently introduced a feature that allows students to estimate their chances of gaining admission into Ivy League schools based on various factors. This project 
aims to analyze the significant factors affecting graduate admissions from an Indian perspective. The analysis will help predict the likelihood of a student's admission, 
given key variables such as CGPA, GRE, TOEFL scores, and others. This will assist Jamboree in providing more accurate admission predictions and recommendations to students.

# Potential Impact:
- Provide actionable insights to Jamboree for better advising students on areas to improve to boost their admission chances.
Enhance the feature on Jamboree’s platform by offering personalized admission predictions, which will improve user engagement.
Help Jamboree students make data-driven decisions, leading to higher satisfaction and more successful admission outcomes.    

# Approach:
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationship between variables such as CGPA, GRE, TOEFL, SOP, LOR, research experience, and university rating with the chances of admission.
- Apply multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Ridge, and ElasticNet, to predict the chances of admission.
- Evaluate and compare model performance using R² scores and error metrics on unseen data.
- Identify and rank the importance of factors that significantly influence admission chances.
